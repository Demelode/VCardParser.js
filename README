VCardParser.js is a VCard parser and composer, this means that is able to parse a vcard into a javascript object
and to compose a javascript object into a VCard.

The VCard format accepted by this tool aims to be compilant with the RFC 2426 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2426.txt)
despite that, some properties could not be parsed, any property not parsed is stored in a NOTPARSED object property
that will be recovered when composing the vcard again.

To see examples of the usage please see the Unit Test in the Test directory.
